This repository contains my work on the assignments and labs from the [TensorFlow Advanced Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques) offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera. 

## About this Specialization
Expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. Learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. Explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs.
